# NppMarkdownPanel
Plugin to preview Markdown files in Notepad++

- lightweight plugin to preview markdown within Notepad++
- displaying rendered markdown html with embedded IE11
- can save rendered html to a file

### Current Version

My ([VinsWorldcom](https://github.com/VinsWorldcom/NppMarkdownPanel)) changes to [UrsineRaven's repo](https://github.com/UrsineRaven/NppMarkdownPanel) can be found [here](https://github.com/VinsWorldcom/NppMarkdownPanel/releases)

The plugin renders Markdown as HTML and provides a viewer.  The plugin can also 
render HTML documents.  Additionally, 10 filters can be created manually in the 
configuration file to render documents to HTML for viewing.  For example:

```
[Filter0]
Extensions=.pl,.pm
Program=pod2html.bat
Arguments=--css C:\notepad++\plugins\NppMarkdownPanel\style.css
```

will render Perl POD to HTML and display in the viewer panel.  There are some 
limitations with filters.  The rendered views do not synchronize scrolling no 
matter what the plugin menu setting is and they do not update "live" with typing, 
only update after document save.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 4.5 or higher 

## Installation

### Installation over Notepad++ 

The plugin can be installed over the integrated Notepad++ "Plugin Admin..".

### Manual Installation

Create the folder "NppMarkdownPanel" in your Notepad++ plugin folder (e.g. "C:\Program Files\Notepad++\plugins") and extract the appropriate zip (x86 or x64) to it.

It should look like this:

![pluginfolder](help/pluginfolder.png "Layout of the plugin folder after installation")

## Usage

After the installation you will find a small purple markdown icon in your toolbar.
Just click it to show the markdown preview. Click again to hide the preview.
Thats all you need to do ;)

![npp-preview](help/npp-preview.png "Layout of the plugin folder after installation")

### Settings

To open the settings for this plugin: Plugins -> NppMarkdownPanel -> Edit Settings

![open-settings](help/open-settings.png)

* #### CSS File
    This allows you to select a CSS file to use if you don't want the default style of the preview

* #### Zoom Level
    This allows you to set the zoom level of the preview

* #### Automatic HTML Output
    This allows you ot select a file to save the rendered HTML to every time the preview is rendered. This is a way to automatically save the rendered content to use elsewhere. Leaving this empty disables the automatic saving.  
    __Note: This is a global setting, so all previewed documents will save to the same file.__

* #### Show Toolbar in Preview Window
    Checking this box will enable the toolbar in the preview window. By default, this is unchecked.

* #### Markdown Extensions
    A comma-separated list of file extensions to recognize as Markdown (default = `.md,.mkdn,.mkd`)

* #### HTML Extensions
    A comma-separated list of file extensions to recognize as HTML (default = `.html,.htm`)
    
    **Note**:  Adding `.xml` to this list will "render" XML files in the viewer if they at least have a valid XML header `<?xml version="1.0"?>`.

### Preview Window Toolbar

* #### Save As... (![save-btn](help/save-btn.png "Picture of the Save button on the preview panel toolbar"))
    Clicking this button allows you to save the rendered preview as an HTML document.

### Synchronize with caret position

Enabling this in the plugin's menu (Plugins -> Markdown Panel) makes the preview panel stay in sync with the caret in the markdown document that is being edited.  This is similar to the _Synchronize Vertical Scrolling_ option of Notepad++ for keeping two open editing panels scrolling together.

![npp-sync-caret](help/sync_caret.gif "Synchronize viewer with caret position")

### Synchronize on vertical scroll

Enabling this in the plugin's menu (Plugins -> Markdown Panel) attempts to do a better job at synchronizing scrolling between the preview panel and the document that is being edited without the need for caret movement (in other words, just using scrollbars should sync too).
